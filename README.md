2. **Create a New Repository**: Create a new repository in your GitHub account, and initialize it with a `README.md` file.

3. **Collaborate with a Classmate**: Collaborate with a classmate who also has a GitHub account. They should have created a repository as well.

   - Select a local path where you want to clone the repository.

5. **Make Changes and Commit**

   - Open the cloned repository in your preferred code editor.
   - Make changes to the `README.md` or other files as needed.
   - Save your changes.

6. **Commit and Push**

   - Go back to GitHub Desktop.
   - You will see the changes listed in the "Changes" tab.

7. **Collaborate with Your Classmate**

   - Ask your classmate to follow the same steps to make changes and push them to the repository.

Congratulations! You have successfully set up a GitHub repository, collaborated with a classmate, and used GitHub Desktop for version control. This lab will help you become familiar with common Git and GitHub workflows.
